## Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Deep Learning 
# Aim
 This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of combining face detection and eye region analysis for drowsiness detection. A deep learning model, EfficientNetB0, trained on a dataset of labeled images, will classify eye states (open/closed) and yawning (yes/no). The combined predictions from these classifications will be used to provide a robust drowsiness assessment.
